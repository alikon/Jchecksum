                   -cli           folder
                   -cli\checksumm folder
                   ...
                   yoursite  folders and files
                   ...
                   bootstrap.php


Run from the command line or terminal.
All you need is PHP configured to run from the command line.    

How it works
run for first time  for take a fingerprints of your site

on your termial write:
php run.php --mode=first


When you want to check for changes 
on your terminal write:
php run.php --mode=check

When you was sure that changes are legitimate make a new fingerprint
on your terminal write:
php run.php --mode=upgrade

good catch
